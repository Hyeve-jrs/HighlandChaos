### This mod is a chaos / randomizer mod inspired by the Yoshi's Island romhack 'Yoshi's Highland'

It adds a wide variety of silly & fun effects, such as:
- Randomly spawning and despawning entities (including items)
- Randomly moving entities around
- Randomly causing blocks to move and fall
- Randomly applying potion effects to the player
- Randomly shuffling and modifying inventory items

### Commands

This mod includes a number of commands for customizing and controlling the effects.
All commands are prefixed with `highland`.
In order to start the effects after loading into a world, you must run `/highlandStart`!

### Multiplayer

Currently, multiplayer is completely untested, but most effects should support it. **Run on a server at your own risk!**
